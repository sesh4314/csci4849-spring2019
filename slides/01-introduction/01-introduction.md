# Input, Interaction, and Accessibility


### CSCI 4849/5849, Shaun Kane, Spring 2018

---
# Today

- Introduction to the course
	- Why it's worth your time
	- What we'll do in the course
- Mini-design activity


---
# But first... a warm up

- Spend 5 minutes talking to your table neighbors

- Ask about
	1. Name
	2. Major and degree program
	3. Any goals for this course
	4. Do you have a superpower? What is it?
	5. What is an **unusual** input device that you use?

---
# What did we learn?

- Superpowers?
	- Wake up at 5am, immune to nosebleeds, never lost money gambling, intuition, immune to darkness effects, super-smell
- Unusual input devices?
	- fingerprint sensor (for gestures), voice commands in TV remote, cardboard box, SNES controller
- We'll get to know each other over the course of the semester

# About the course


---
# CSCI 4849/5849

- Input → how to control our computing devices
- Interaction → designing interactive systems
- Accessibility → focus on "extra-ordinary" interactions

---
## Is this an input course or an accessibility course?

- In some ways, it's a weird hybrid
	- What I know best, and care about most
	- But it's interesting (I'll show you why)
	- And it's useful (I'll show you how)

^ Often we will see these as two separate courses: input and interaction, and accessibility. But I was always taught to take classes about XYZ from the experts on XYZ, and this is what I know best.

---
# (Some) goals of the course

- Survey of how we interact with computing technologies: pointing, text entry, gesture, speech, etc.
- Consider users' abilities in context
- Identify disconnects between a user's ability and modes of interaction
- Explore "extra-ordinary" use cases: users with differing abilities, emerging user interface technologies
- Build prototypes of interactive systems (GUI, speech, eye gaze, etc.)
- Employ human-computer interaction (HCI) methods to remove technology barriers

---
# CSCI 5839 vs. 5849 
### (and 3002 vs. 4849)

- More building and prototyping
- Focus on emerging interaction modes (speech, voice, etc.)
- Emphasis on understanding human capabilities in context

---
# But why is this useful?

![right](images/demonic-posession.jpg)

- As computer scientists, we have a real opportunity to improve fairness and equality by considering and including underrepresented groups
- OK great, but what if I don't care about that? What if I think disability is a sign of demonic posession?
	- Knowing this stuff is still useful

## Emerging technology

![right](images/minority-report.jpg)

- How do we take advantage of new interactive technologies?
- How to understand what works and doesn't work (and why)?

^ Image: user interface from Minority Report features in-air gestures
^ This is an example of the "gorilla arm" effect. Humans are really bad at maintaining this kind of pose.

---
# PWD are tech explorers

![75% right](images/courage-wolf.jpg)

- People with disabilities often encounter (and solve) tech problems before everyone else does
- Examples: texting, speech-based interfaces, eye gaze

^ Image: Courage wolf meme says "Have a disability, playing life on hard mode"

---
# AT is cool
![75% right](images/cool-AT.png)

- Assistive technology is cool
- Accessible design is often good design
- Examples: Good Grips kitchen tools, carbon fiber prosthetic legs, fashionable eye glasses, 3D printed Iron Man prosthetic hand

^ Image: Examples of these AT devices

---
# Abilities are dynamic
![right](images/mit-astronaut.jpg)

- Consider:
	- Older adult with Parkinson's disease
	- Astronaut on a space walk
	- Violinist during a performance
- Each experiences reduced or no hand dexterity
- Experience similar in some ways, different in others (can they change situation? training?)
- Core question: what is the user's ability in context?

^ Image: Astronaut in a space suit with bulky gloves

---
# GUI design is boring

- Quick: imagine the user interface for a mobile phone messaging app
- Everyone can do it, and the end results will probably be very similar and **boring**
- Where is interesting design happening? 
	- Emerging and atypical interactions

---
# More examples of Cool AT

- [Microsoft Eye Gaze Wheelchair] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-UwDnN_3-Q)
- [Steve Gleason, eye-gaze communication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXOWTLrWqzg)
- [Freedom Machines documentary shows various ATs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHgppLJcRaA)

---
# How will this help me?

- May open up job opportunities ([teachaccess.org](http://teachaccess,org))
- Get a head start on emerging trends in interaction (e.g. voice interfaces)
- Practice in designing technology to match user needs and abilities
- Assistive technology is a great area to explore innovative design

^ People with disabilities are often willing to try crazy stuff, because their existing technologies suck.
